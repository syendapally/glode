# glode

Glode is a programming language and IDE that enables developers to code in their native languages, leveraging generative AI. This is a rough draft beta version, and significant changes and improvements are planned as we refine and expand the project. Glode aims to make programming more accessible and inclusive, bridging the gap between technology and diverse linguistic communities.

🚀 Features (Beta)
	•	Write code in multiple natural languages.
	•	Translates and executes native-language code into a universal format.
	•	Simplified syntax designed for global users.
	•	Still in development—expect updates and improvements.

🌐 Supported Languages

Glode currently supports a selection of languages, including English, Hindi, Mandarin, Spanish, French, and others. However, this is a work in progress, and more languages and refinements will be added over time. You can view the current language syntax in the language syntax JSON file.

🤝 Contributing

This project is in its early stages, and I used tools like ChatGPT to generate the initial JSON syntax for various languages, as I don’t personally know them all. If you’re fluent in a language or want to add support for a new language, your help is greatly appreciated!

How to Contribute:
	1.	Fork this repository.
	2.	Add or improve syntax definitions in the language syntax JSON file.
	3.	Submit a pull request with your contributions.
